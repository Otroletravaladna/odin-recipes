        <h2>Learn how to do this latin-american traditional and delicious dish in a few steps!</h2>
        <p>There's plenty ways to make the famous "Chipa" but the difference in thr recipe i'm showing 
            is that this is gluten free. It is for this reason that we need to be extra careful with the treatment of 
            the ingredients and the cross contamination. We are gonna need some almond flour and of course a lot of cheese!

        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
